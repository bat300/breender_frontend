Wasabi is the son of a champion Pekingese and the great-grandson of Malachy, the 2012 Best in Show winner who was also bred and shown by Wasabi’s owner and handler, David Fitzpatrick.',

The rules would also forbid owners from tying up dogs for long periods of time or leaving them alone all day. Around one in five German homes has a dog; over 9 million dogs are kept as pets in the country. "Pets are not cuddly toys — and their needs have to be considered," Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner said Monday.
